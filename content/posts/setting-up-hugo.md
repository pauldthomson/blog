title = 'Setting Up Hugo with Bear Cub Theme'
+++

Hugo is an excellent static site generator that's perfect for blogs and personal websites. Here's how I set up this blog using Hugo and the Bear Cub theme.

## Why Hugo?

Hugo offers several advantages:

- **Speed**: Extremely fast build times, even for large sites
- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn and use
- **Flexibility**: Powerful templating system and content management
- **No dependencies**: Single binary with no external dependencies

## The Bear Cub Theme

I chose the [Bear Cub theme](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub) for this blog because it's:

- Lightweight and fast-loading
- Accessible and SEO-optimized  
- Responsive across all devices
- Privacy-focused with no external scripts

## Getting Started

Setting up Hugo is straightforward:

1. Install Hugo on your system
2. Create a new site with `hugo new site myblog`
3. Add the Bear Cub theme as a git submodule
4. Configure your `hugo.toml` file
5. Start writing content!

The result is a clean, fast website that focuses on content over flashy features.
